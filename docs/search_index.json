The courses offer in-depth instruction on data collection, data management, programming, and visualization, using data examples relevant to data-intensive research. 0.2 Time and place Students for ERHS 535, ERHS 581A3, and ERHS 581A4 will meet together. Students in ERHS 535 will meet for the entire semester, completing a three-credit course. Students in ERHS 581A3 will meet for the first five weeks of the semester, completing a one-credit course. Students in ERHS 581A4 will meet from the sixth week to the final week of the semester, completing a two-credit course. For the first five weeks of class, the course meets in the first-floor classroom of the Military Sciences building on Mondays and Wednesdays, 10:00 am–11:50 am. For the remaining weeks, the course meets in Room 120 of the Environmental Health Building on Mondays and Wednesdays, 10:00 am–12:00 pm. Exceptions to these meeting times are: There will be no meeting on Labor Day (Monday, Sept. 2). There are no course meetings the week of Thanksgiving (week of Nov. 25). Office hours will be 10:00–11:00 AM on Fridays in EH 120. 0.3 Detailed schedule Here is a more detailed view of the schedule for this course for Fall 2019: Week Class dates Level Lecture content Graded items 1 Aug. 26, 28 Preliminary R Preliminaries 2 Sept. 4 Basic Entering and cleaning data Quiz (W) 3 Sept. 9, 11 Basic Exploring data Quiz (W), HW #1 (F) 4 Sept. 16, 18 Basic Reporting data results Quiz (W) 5 Sept. 23, 25 Basic Reproducible Research Quiz (W), HW #2 (F) 6 Sept. 30, Oct. 2 Intermediate Entering and cleaning data Quiz (W) 7 Oct. 7, 9 Intermediate Exploring data Quiz (W) 8 Oct. 14, 16 Intermediate Reporting data results Quiz (W), HW #3 (W) 9 Oct. 21, 23 Intermediate Reproducible Research Quiz (W) 10 Oct. 28, 30 Advanced Entering and cleaning data Quiz (W), HW #4 (F) 11 Nov. 4, 6 Advanced Exploring data 12 Nov. 11, 13 Advanced Exploring data (mapping) HW #5 (F) 13 Nov. 18, 20 Advanced Reporting data results 14 Dec. 2, 4 Advanced Reproducible Research HW #6 (F) 15 Dec. 9, 11 Advanced Continuing in R Project draft (M) 16 Week of Dec. 16 Group presentations Final project Students in ERHS 581A3 will be in weeks 1–5 of this schedule. Students in ERHS 581A4 will be in weeks 6–16 of this schedule. 0.4 Grading 0.4.1 Grading for ERHS 535 For ERHS 535, course grades will be determined by the following five components: Assessment component Percent of grade Final group project 30 Weekly in-class quizzes, weeks 2-10 25 Six homework assignments 25 Attendance and class participation 10 Weekly in-course group exercises 10 0.4.2 Grading for ERHS 581A3 For ERHS 581A3, course grades will be determined by the following four components: Assessment component Percent of grade Weekly in-class quizzes, weeks 2-5 40 Two homework assignments 30 Attendance and class participation 10 Weekly in-course group exercises 20 0.4.3 Grading for ERHS 581A4 For ERHS 581A4, course grades will be determined by the following five components: Assessment component Percent of grade Final group project 30 Weekly in-class quizzes, weeks 1–5 (weeks 6–10 of the semester) 25 Four homework assignments 30 Attendance and class participation 5 Weekly in-course group exercises 10 0.4.4 Attendance and class participation Because so much of the learning for this class is through interactive work in class, it is critical that you come to class. If you are in ERHS 535, out of a possible 10 points for class attendance, you will get: 10 points if you miss two or fewer classes 8 points if you miss three classes 6 points if you miss four classes 4 points if you miss five classes 2 points if you miss six classes 0 points if you miss seven or more classes If you are in ERHS 581A3 or ERHS581A4, out of a possible 10 points for class attendance, you will get: 10 points if you miss one or fewer classes 8 points if you miss two classes 6 points if you miss three classes 4 points if you miss four classes 2 points if you miss five classes 0 points if you miss six or more classes Exceptions: Attendance on the first day of class (Aug. 26) will not be counted. If you miss classes for “University-sanctioned”\" activities. These can include attending a conference, travel to collect data for your dissertation), For these absences, you must inform prior to the date that you will be absence. No points will be lost for attendance if you provide a signed letter from your research adviser by Dec. 11, 2017 (start of finals week), and you can make arrangements with me to make up any missed work. For more details, see CSU’s Academic Policies on Course Attendance. If you have to miss class for a serious medical issue (e.g., operation, sickness severe enough to require a doctor’s visit), the absence will be excused if you bring in a note from a doctor of other medical professional giving the date you missed and that it was for a serious medical issue. For an absence to be excused, you must email me a copy of the letter by 5:00 pm the Friday afternoon of the week of the class you missed. 0.4.5 Weekly in-course group exercises Part of each class will be spent doing in-course group exercises. As long as you are in class and participate in these exercises, you will get full credit for this component. If you miss a class, to get credit towards this component of your grade, you will need to turn a few paragraphs describing what was covered in the exercise and what you learned. To get credit for this, you must submit it to me by email by 5:00 pm the Friday afternoon of the week of the class you missed. All in-class exercises are included in the online course book at the end of the chapter on the associated material. 0.4.6 In-class quizzes There will be weekly in-course quizzes for weeks 2–10 of the course. Students in ERHS 535 will take all these quizzes. Students in ERHS 581A3 will take quizzes in weeks 2–5. Students in ERHS 581A4 will take quizzes in weeks 6–10. Each quiz will have at least 10 questions. Typically, a quiz will have more questions, usually 12–15 questions. The grading of the quizzes is structures so that you can get full credit for the quiz portion of the grade without getting 100% of quiz questions right. Instead, if you get ten questions right per quiz on average, you will get full credit for the quiz portion of the grade. Once you reach the maximum possible points on quizzes, you can continue to take the quizzes for practice, or you can choose to skip any following quizzes. Quiz questions will be multiple choice, matching, or very short answers. The “Vocabulary” appendix of our online book has the list of material for which you will be responsible for this quiz. Most of the functions and concepts will have been covered in class, but some may not. You are responsible for going through the list and, if there are things you don’t know or remember from class, learning them. To do this, you can use help functions in R, Google, StackOverflow, books on R, ask a friend, and any other resource you can find. The final version of the Vocabulary list you will be responsible will be posted by the Wednesday evening before each quiz. In general, using R frequently in your research or other coursework will help you to prepare and do well on these quizzes. You can not make up a quiz for a class period you missed. You can still get full credit on your total possible quiz points if you miss a class, but it means you will have to work harder and get more questions right for days you are in class. 0.4.6.1 Quiz grade calculations for ERHS 535 For students in ERHS 581A3, the nine quizzes in weeks 2–10 count for 25 points of the final grade. The final quiz total for students in ERHS 535 will be calculated as: \\[ \\mbox{Quiz grade} = 25 * \\frac{\\mbox{Number of correct quiz answers}}{90} \\] 0.4.6.2 Quiz grade calculations for ERHS 581A3 For students in ERHS 581A3, the four quizzes in weeks 2–5 count for 40 points of the final grade. The final quiz total for students in ERHS 581A3 will be calculated as: \\[ \\mbox{Quiz grade} = 40 * \\frac{\\mbox{Number of correct quiz answers}}{40} \\] 0.4.6.3 Quiz grade calculations for ERHS 581A4 For students in ERHS 581A4, the five quizzes in weeks 6–10 count for 25 points of the final grade. The final quiz total for students in ERHS 581A3 will be calculated as: \\[ \\mbox{Quiz grade} = 25 * \\frac{\\mbox{Number of correct quiz answers}}{50} \\] 0.4.7 Homework There will be homework assignments due every two to three weeks during the course, starting the third week of the course (see the detailed schedule in the online course book for exact due dates). The first two homeworks (HWs #1 and # 2) should be done individually. For later homeworks, you may be given the option to work in small groups of approximately three students. Homeworks will be graded for correctness, but some partial credit will be given for questions you try but fail to answer correctly. Some of the exercises will not have “correct” answers, but instead will be graded on completeness. For later homeworks, a subset of the full set of questions will be selected for which I will do a detailed grading of the code itself, with substantial feedback on coding. All other questions in the homework will be graded for completeness and based on the final answer produced. Homework is due to me by email by 5:00 pm on the Friday it is due. Your grade will be reduced by 10 points for each day it is late, and will receive no credit if it is late by over a week. 0.4.8 Final group project For the final project, you will work in small groups (3–4 people) on an R programming challenge. The final grade will be based on the resulting R software, as well as on a short group presentation and written report describing your work. You will be given a lot of in-class time during the last third of the semester to work with your group on this project, and you will also need to spend some time working outside of class to complete the project. More details on this project will be provided later in the semester. 0.5 Course set-up Please download and install the latest version of R and RStudio (Desktop version, Open Source edition) installed. Both are free for anyone to download. Students in ERHS 535 and ERHS 581A4 will also need to download and install a version of LaTeX (MikTeX for Windows and MacTeX for Macs). They will also need to download and install git software and create a GitHub account. Here are useful links for this set-up: R: https://cran.r-project.org RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop Install MikTeX: https://miktex.org/ (only ERHS 535 / 581A4 with Windows) Install MacTeX: http://www.tug.org/mactex/ (only ERHS 535 / 581A4 with Macs) Install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads (only ERHS 535 / 581A4) Sign-up for a GitHub account: https://github.com (only ERHS 535 / 581A4) 0.6 Coursebook This coursebook will serve as the only required textbook for this course. I am still in the process of editing and adding to this book, so content may change somewhat over the semester (particularly for later weeks, which is currently in a rawer draft than the beginning of the book). We typically cover about a chapter of the book each week of the course. This coursebook includes: Links to the slides presented in class for each topic In-course exercises, typically including links to the data used in the exercise An appendix with homework assignments A list of vocabulary and concepts that should be mastered for each quiz If you find any typos or bugs, or if you have any suggestions for how the book can be improved, feel free to post it on the book’s GitHub Issues page. This book was developed using Yihui Xie’s wonderful bookdown framework. The book is built using code that combines R code, data, and text to create a book for which R code and examples can be re-executed every time the book is re-built, which helps identify bugs and broken code examples quickly. The online book is hosted using GitHub’s free GitHub Pages. All material for this book is available and can be explored at the book’s GitHub repository. 0.6.1 Other helpful books (not required) The best book to supplement the coursebook and lectures for this course is R for Data Science, by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. The entire book is freely available online through the same format at the coursebook. You can also purchase a paper version of the book (published by O’Reilly) through Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, etc., for around $40. This book is an excellent and up-to-date reference by some of the best R programmers in the world. There are a number of other useful books available on general R programming, including: R for Dummies R Cookbook R Graphics Cookbook Roger Peng’s Leanpub books Various books on bookdown.org The R programming language is used extensively within certain fields, including statistics and bioinformatics. If you are using R for a specific type of analysis, you will be able to find many books with advice on using R for both general and specific statistical analysis, including many available in print or online through the CSU library.
